# About us

Meeq Corporation was founded by Christopher Bonhage in 2024,
and is a registered S-Corporation in the State of Pennsylvania.

## What is "Meeq"?

The Mirriam-Webster dictionary provides a modern definition for the word "meek" that implies weakness:
enduring injury with patience; deficient in spirit and courage; not violent or strong.

However, the Biblical translation of "meek" comes from the Greek word "praus", which has
an entirely different connotation:
gentle; with humility and consideration; strength under control; possessing steady courage.

It is from this Biblical understanding of meekness that Meeq Corporation takes its name.
