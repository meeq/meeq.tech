Consulting services are provided by Christopher Bonhage,
a United States citizen and software engineer based out of Birdsboro, Pennsylvania.

Christopher has extensive software development knowledge and experience using a multitude of programming languages
and frameworks. He has created rapidly-iterated prototypes as well as battle-tested, cross-datacenter production systems.

Christopher got his start in the software industry while working at an Apple Store as a technician; he started building
software tools to optimize his workflow, and shared those tools with others, which led to an opportunity to move out
to Cupertino and work for Apple's Information Systems and Technology group. He also worked on Apple TV and TVMLKit,
and presented on-stage at WWDC 2016 in a tvOS Developer Session.
